// Handler is short-formed as 'hdlr'.
// This box within a Media Box declares media type of the track, and thus the process by which the media‚Äêdata in the track is presented.
// For example, a format for which the decoder delivers video would be stored in a video track, identified by being handled by a video handler.
// The documentation of the storage of a media format identifies the media type which that format uses.
// This box when present within a Meta Box, declares the structure or format of the 'meta' box contents.
// There is a general handler for metadata streams of any type; the specific format is identified by the sample entry, as for video or audio, for example.
